===========================================================

.. Here is were you specify the content and order of your new book.

.. Each section heading (e.g. "SECTION 1: A Random Section") will be
   a heading in the table of contents. Source files that should be
   generated and included in that section should be placed on individual
   lines, with one line separating the first source filename and the
   :maxdepth: line.

.. Sources can also be included from subfolders of this directory.
   (e.g. "DataStructures/queues.rst").

Study Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thank you for taking part in this study! We are researchers who are trying
to improve the teaching and learning of programming.

This study has four parts. It will take approximately 60 minutes to complete the study.  
Please do the parts in order and answer questions to the best of your ability without any outside help. 
You can stop working on a problem after you worked on it for about five minutes without solving it.

If you have questions about this study, please email Xinying Hou at xyhou@umich.edu.

The four parts are:

- **Skill Assessment** - One write-code question to decide whether this write-code practice is challenging enough for you.
- **Introduction to the Programming Help** - A brief overview of the new help feature designed to assist while writing code.
- **Practice** - Write-code practice problems with survey questions. You are required to think aloud during the process.
- **Post Interview** - Interview questions about your practice experience.
